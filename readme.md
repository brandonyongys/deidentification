# Project description
This is a simple project on de-identification of data. The current usage is limited to structured data where the entire string is de-identified. 

The project is yet to be expanded to encompass de-identification of free text data.

# Installation instructions
Create and activate a virtual environment with `python 3.8.8`. Install all the required packages using the `requirements.txt` file. The main packages are `hashlib` and `random`.
~~~
py -m venv venv
venv\scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
~~~

# Usage instructions
Run the jupyter notebooks by changing the kernel to the said venv. Refer to the two notebooks - 'deidentifying strings.ipynb' and 'deidentifying dates.ipynb' on how to de-identify strings and dates.
